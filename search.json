Some logs can be closed after the update process, while others need to be re-assigned for further processing.\nThe update process has been streamlined to the point that updates can be easily and quickly completed in bulk/batches. Manually closing and re-assigning up to 100+ logs at a time proved to be a tedious hassle, so I created some scripts to automate the process using Selenium.",
